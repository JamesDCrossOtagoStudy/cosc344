    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>We implement the transaction simulation which involve 3 entity:</p>
    <p>book, customer, employee. It further related to bookstore, transactions and book_tran.</p>
    <p><strong>All form input related to foreign key, we use selection list to reference this relationship.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>We also use Ajax and jQuery to improve the operation experience.</strong></p>
    <p>Because of the limited time, we can display the bookstore, book, employee and customer table. </p>
    <p>And can only edit bookstore and employee information.<p>
    <p>The transactions simulation part, we simulated the process of one customer purchase some book and checkout.</p>

    <h2>
        <a href="transaction/transactionProcess.php">Shopping Process Simulation</a>
    </h2>
    <p>During this simulation process:</p>
    <p>We must select the employee who is responsible for this purchasing operation.</p>
    <p>select the customer who is buying the book,</p>
    <p>select the book item and add them into shopping list,</p>
    <p>finally, press the checkout button to finish the transaction.</p>
    <p><strong>Because, we don't use session, so this purchasing process only allow a one customer at one time.</strong></p>
